# DO NOT TRUST

**Do not** add this CA certificate to the system trust store or in production code!!!

The CA's private key is public and anyone can use it to issue certificates that will be trusted by a system with this CA in the trust store.

It should be only used for emulating a CA inside the SEED Emulator.
